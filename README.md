# Rollerfeet string lights

Arduino holiday lights using FastLED and Blynk.

## v2.0 baseline

Imported existing source, with Wi-Fi name/password, Blynk template ID and auth token replaced by placeholders before the first commit. Original private files remain with the owner. Generated firmware/build output is excluded because it can contain embedded credentials. The import manifest records SHA-256 comparisons; the other 12 source files are byte-identical.

Saved build evidence points to Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 (likely Sense hardware). This is not yet a live chip identification. Source configuration: WS2811, RGB, GPIO 4, 300 pixels (6 × 50). Brightness varies by animation; the startup value is not a global cap.

Open `XIAO_ESP32_holiday_lights/XIAO_ESP32_holiday_lights.ino` directly from this checkout in Arduino IDE. The folder and main sketch names must match. All sibling .ino tabs belong to the sketch.

Dependencies observed at import: Espressif esp32 core 3.3.10, FastLED 3.10.5, Blynk 1.3.5. Compilation and hardware behavior have not yet been verified.

This import preserves legacy animation behavior and comments; it does not assert third-party authorship or introduce a blanket license.
